Go/SWIG/SCons sandbox
---------------------

This is an example/proving ground for using go with c++ through SWIG, and using SCons to control the build process.

Yes, I know it is non-go-like to use external tools like SCons. I want something that will work in a unified way with c++, and I'm sick of make. Possibly the go tool or go-gb could be integrated nicely here.

I also reserve the right to decide SWIG isn't worth it and the better way is to use only cgo.
